# VSCode Setup

A number of things to know about my VSCode setup:

- There are a lot of modified keybindings.
- I use a lot of extensions (check out `../backup/vscode-extensions-backup.txt` for the full list). That makes startup time not the greatest, but honestly once things are up and running things are pretty smoothe, so I'm not complaining about it (yet).
- I am am largely dependent on [VSpaceCode](https://github.com/VSpaceCode/VSpaceCode) to navigate, and swap between [VSCodeVim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) and [vscode-neovim](https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim) on what seems like a daily basis. Once vscode-neovim gets more traction, I'm assuming I'll be going with that extension full-time, but there are [some](https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim/issues/409) [things](https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim/issues/408) that drive me crazy about its current implementation that VSCodeVim gets right, so unfortunately I'm in this limbo.
