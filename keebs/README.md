This is where I keep my keyboard configurations. See below for some “gotchas” that you should know if you’re going to compile some of these.

## Custom Configurations

Take the keymap generated by the [QMK configurator](config.qmk.fm) and name it `keymap.json` (this is important).

Then, take the `config.h`/`rules.mk` file from the default layout and change whatever options you’d like (like [these](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/config_options?id=the-configh-file)). Put these files (`cofig.h`/`rules.mk`/`keymap.json`) into the relevant `$QMK_HOME/keyboard/<keyboards-name>/keymaps/<keymaps-name>` folder to prep for the last step.

When you’re ready, compile the keyboard like so:

```bash
qmk compile -kb <keyboards-name> -km <keymaps-name>
```

The newly-compiled binary will be in the `$QMK_HOME/.build` directory.
