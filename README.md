A place for files with dots at the beginning of them.

As is the trend, I am joining [many others](https://dotfiles.github.io/) in the programmer's natural fascination with dotfiles; how they're set up, what new toys are hidden in their obscure references, and how much time we can waste just putting them all together. My dotfiles are shameful, but they're mine.

All PRs will be considered, but ultimately ignored.
