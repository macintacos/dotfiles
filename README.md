# dotfiles
A place for files with dots at the beginning of them.

As is the trend, I am joining [many others](https://dotfiles.github.io/) in the natural programmer's fascination with dotfiles; what's in them, what new toys are hidden in their obscure references, and how much time I can waste just putting them all together. My dotfiles are shameful, but they're mine.

All PRs will be considered, but then ultimately thrown out.
