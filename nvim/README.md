# My Neovim Config

A few things to know about my config:

- I use [`vim-which-key`](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-which-key) _a lot_. I am trying to do my best to emulate Spacemacs and SpaceVim (but with differences that make sense to me). I want it to essentially be a lighter-weight version of both.
- Despite wanting to be a “lightweight” version of the aforementioned programs, that doesn’t mean I’m scared of plugins. I use plugins with reckless abandon. This is not the kind of config that you will like if you want to keep your setup “minimal”.

This config is provided as-is; I don’t necessarily want any suggestions (unless they’re _really_ good).
