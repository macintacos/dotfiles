# My ZSH Configuration

There are many like it, but this one is mine. Here's what you get:

- A nice, responsive shell with [`powerlevel10k`](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) (essentially no re-render time)
- "Vim" mode thanks to [`zsh-vi-mode`](https://github.com/jeffreytse/zsh-vi-mode)

I mostly use `fish` now, so this is a light config so that I don't have to deal with weirdness when I need to use `zsh`.
