- Fisher is used for plugin management.
- Tide is my shell config (although this could change)
- Meant to essentially be a drop-in replacement of my ZSH configuration, although Fish-ified to the point where I get the convenience of their language/commands and can leave behind the unpredeictable (IMO, obviously) nature of ZSH configuration management.
